# Assignment Three : Password Generator

## My Process

I approached this assignment with the idea of building a contained password component that could be picked up and dropped into an application. I had a lot of fun exploring JavaScript to get the functionality that was required in the Acceptance Criteria. 

I was able to successfully research the functionality needed as well as come up with solutions on my own, which felt like an accomplishment in and of itself. I was also able to successfully work through a bug in which the password generation function was firing twice.

## Notes

I adapted the User Story a bit by having the user input the criteria of the password via a slider and a set of checkboxes PRIOR to generating the password. I did this as I believe it is an enhancment to the UX over a series of prompts as intially stated. This was an intentional design decision which I belive is a value add to the component.

I also added the functionality for the user to copy the password quickly and easily via a copy button. This gave me the opportunity to explore the JavaScript Clipboard API. The functionality appears to be working as intended, but it is difficult to say without proper user testing. Something that would also reveal if the feature itself is even necessary to begin with.
